# Folder cleaner

In this project I created a python program to clean folders (e.g. sort files by file extension, date or url where it has been downloaded) and change the name of the files.

## Functionalities

- Change file name to [YYMMDD_descriptionInCamelCase_modification_version.fileExtension]
- Files should be move to folders that contain ... as names:
  - File extension
  - Year-Month
